## what this app does

This React application allows users to explore available properties in a simulated environment. Users can navigate through three towers, each containing 12 floors, with four apartments per floor. Each apartment varies in the number of rooms. The app is designed as a demo for property browsing, helping users visualize different property options offered by propertyVisualizer.

- Only supports 3 towers, 12 floors per tower, and 4 apartments per floor hardcoded for demo purposes
- No backend integration; all data is static and for demonstration only
- Limited filtering and search capabilities
- No authentication or user accounts
